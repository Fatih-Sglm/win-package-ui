# Product Context

Why this exists:
- Windows lacks a modern, unified GUI for managing packages across WinGet, Chocolatey and MS Store with a consistent UX. This product aims to fill that gap.

Problems solved:
- Unified search across multiple registries
- Easy install/uninstall with progress reporting
- Insight into installed apps and available updates
- Themeable, modern UI for discoverability and ease-of-use

How it should work:
- Fast search and discovery with filters (source, category)
- Clear package pages showing details, versions, and actions (Install/Remove/Change Version)
- A "Discover" landing page showing popular and trending apps
- A "My Packages" view listing installed apps with actions
- Persistent user preferences and theme system via memory bank

UX goals:
- Minimal, clear, and responsive UI
- Visible feedback for long-running operations
- Accessible controls and keyboard-friendly search
