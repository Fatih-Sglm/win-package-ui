# Project Brief

Project: WinPackage UI — Desktop Package Manager UI for Windows

Goal: Build a modern, extensible desktop application that allows Windows users to discover, install, update, and remove applications from multiple package sources (WinGet, Chocolatey, MS Store). Provide a rich, themeable UI inspired by popular package manager UIs (Pacman/Flatpak style), with features for searching, popular apps, installed packages, package details, version switching, and an extensible theme/extension store.

Core success criteria:
- Discover & Search: fast, relevant search across multiple sources
- Install/Uninstall/Change Version: seamless operations with progress and results
- Installed list: accurate reflection of system-installed packages
- Theme system: parametric themes with easy addition via an extension store
- Performance: cache popular/metadata to reduce repeated remote calls
- Safety: interactive mode for prompts, and sensible permission handling

Primary audience: Windows power users and system administrators who prefer GUI tools for package management.
